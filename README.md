# MNIST-CIFAR-NN
This repo contains code to:
- Training a Logistic Regression classifier on MNIST  
- Implementing a lightweight Fully-Connected Neural Network (FNN) for CIFAR-10  
- Running a simple hyperparameter search with early stopping  

## Highlights
- **MNIST (LogReg):** ~92% test accuracy in a few minutes on GPU  
- **CIFAR-10 (FNN):** Compact 2-hidden-layer neural network built from scratch  
- **Tuning:** Grid search over learning rate, weight decay, and batch size  
- **Clean structure:** Separate training, validation, and testing pipelines
